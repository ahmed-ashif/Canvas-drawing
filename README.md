# Canvas Drawing
<br/>
Creating a canvas drawing website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves several key steps and components. This type of project allows users to draw anything in their web browsers. Below is a brief description of how such a website is structured and functions:
<br/>
Canvas Element: At the core of the drawing functionality is the <canvas> element. This is where all the drawing takes place.
Context Setup: JavaScript is used to get the 2D context of the canvas, which provides methods for drawing shapes, lines, and images.
Drawing Functions: Functions to handle drawing operations, such as drawing shapes (rectangles, circles), lines, and freehand drawing.
Event Listeners: JavaScript event listeners to capture user interactions like mouse clicks, movements, and key presses to interact with the canvas dynamically.
